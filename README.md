# DFT
A calculator that takes user inputs to compute a DFT and returns the frequency bin as a complex number which is then saved in a new text file.

This was made for a high school project which relates to the Fast Fourier Transform in image processing(2D FFT). However, This program computes for 1D DFT rather than 2D. This was made to understand the formula and get an idea of how the FFT algorithm works at a much simpler and smaller scale.

The FFT algorithm is an efficient implementation of the DFT; it reduces computational time whilst producing the same result.

Below is the 2D DFT formula

Below is the 1D DFT formula, this is what my program is calculating.
