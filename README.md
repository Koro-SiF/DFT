# DFT
A calculator that takes user inputs to compute a dft and returns the frequency bin as a complex number(I'm still a beginner in programming so it might not be the best code)

As of now I am a 17 yo high school student, I am making this as a personal project but also in order to help me in my school project which relates to the Fast Fourier Transform in image process(which in this case is 2D rather than 1D as in my calculator). 

So as you can tell I'm not that experienced in coding, but I'm getting there and this is my best/most complex script so far. Any feedback is greatly appreciated as I am trying to learn more and more about programming in C#, Java, and Python a the moment.
