# DFT
A calculator that takes user inputs to compute a dft and returns the frequency bin as a complex number which is then saved in a new text file.

This was made for a high school project which relates to the Fast Fourier Transform in image process(2D FFT). However, This program computes for 1D DFT rather than 2D. It is used to understand the formula and get an idea of how FFT algorithm is done at a much simpler and smaller scale.

FFT is a more efficient version of the DFT, but at their core they shares the same basis.

Below is the 2D FFT/DFT formula

Below is the 1D FFT/DFT formula, this is what my program is doing
